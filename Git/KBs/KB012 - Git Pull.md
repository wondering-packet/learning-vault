### **What it is:**

`git pull` is a command used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. It is a combination of two other commands: `git fetch` followed by either a `git merge` (by default) or a `git rebase` (with the `--rebase` flag).

### **Purpose:**

The primary purpose of `git pull` is to synchronize your local branch with its remote counterpart. It's a quick way to get all the latest changes that your teammates have pushed to the remote repository. This is a fundamental part of staying up-to-date in a collaborative project.

### **Real world application:**

Imagine you start your workday and need to work on a new feature. Before you write any code, you run `git pull` on the `main` branch. This command reaches out to the remote server, downloads all the new commits your colleagues made the previous day, and automatically merges them into your local `main` branch. This ensures you're working with the most recent code and helps prevent merge conflicts later on.

### **`git pull` vs. `git pull --rebase`**

This is where the magic happens and where you control your commit history. Both commands do the same initial step: they `git fetch` the latest commits from the remote. The difference lies in what happens next.

#### **`git pull` (Default behavior)**

- **What it does:** Fetches the remote commits and performs a **`git merge`**. It creates a **new merge commit** in your local history to combine the remote changes with your local changes.
    
- **Best for:** Workflows where preserving the exact history of when a merge occurred is important. It's safe and doesn't rewrite history.
    
- **History:** Creates a non-linear history with explicit merge commits.
    

#### **`git pull --rebase`**

- **What it does:** Fetches the remote commits and performs a **`git rebase`**. It temporarily sets aside your local commits, fast-forwards your branch to the remote's latest state, and then **reapplies your local commits on top**.
    
- **Best for:** Maintaining a clean, linear history. It makes it look like you started your work from the latest version of the remote branch.
    
- **History:** Creates a perfectly linear history, with no extra merge commits. This is the preferred method for many teams to keep the `git log` tidy.
    

#### **Example: A Visual Comparison**

**The Scenario:**

- Your local `main` branch is at commit `C`. You add a new commit `D`.
    
- While you were working, a teammate added a new commit `E` to the remote `main` branch.
    

**`git pull`**

```
# The command you ran:
git pull

# Your local history after the command:
A---B---C---E---D'---F (F is the new merge commit)
```

A new merge commit `F` is created to combine the histories.

**`git pull --rebase`**

```
# The command you ran:
git pull --rebase

# Your local history after the command:
A---B---C---E---D'
```

Your commit `D` is temporarily set aside, the remote commit `E` is pulled, and then your commit is re-applied on top as a new commit `D'`. The history is a straight line.

### **Example Commands:**

Bash

```
# Fetches and merges remote changes (default behavior)
git pull

# Fetches and rebases remote changes
git pull --rebase

# You can configure this to be the default for your repo
git config pull.rebase true
```
