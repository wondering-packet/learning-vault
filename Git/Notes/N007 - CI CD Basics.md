## **1. What is CI/CD?**

- **CI** = **Continuous Integration**
    
    - Automatically test & validate your code every time you push changes.
    - Goal: Catch bugs early & keep `main` branch stable.
    
- **CD** = **Continuous Delivery** / **Continuous Deployment**
    
    - Automatically deploy tested code to production or staging after it passes CI checks.
    - **Delivery** â†’ Requires a human to approve deploy.
    - **Deployment** â†’ Fully automated deploy.

**ðŸ’¡ Analogy:**  
Think of CI/CD like having a robotic pit crew. Every time you bring your car (code) into the pit (push), they **check it**, **fix issues**, and **send it out** without you lifting a wrench.

**Why it matters**:  

CI/CD creates a feedback loop that ensures:
- Problems are caught early (in minutes, not days).
- Code is always in a deployable state.
- Developers spend less time fixing integration issues and more time delivering features.

## **2. Where Git Fits into CI/CD**

Git acts as the **trigger** for automation.

- Push code â†’ Automation pipeline runs.
- Merge PR â†’ Tests run automatically.
- Tag release â†’ Deployment job runs.

## **3. What are Quality Gates?**

Quality gates are **checkpoints** in the CI/CD pipeline that code must pass before being merged or deployed.  

Think of them as **filters** to prevent bad code from entering the main branch.

Common quality gates:
- **Code formatting checks** â€“ enforce consistent style.
- **Linting** â€“ detect syntax errors, unused variables, and style violations.
- **Automated tests** â€“ verify functionality.
- **Coverage thresholds** â€“ ensure enough of your code is tested.

You can implement quality gates using Hooks (e.g. pre-commit hook - this run on local machine) & CI workflow (e.g since we are using Github, we can use Github Actions - this runs on remote server).

## **3. Git Hooks**

Git itself has a built-in **hooks** system:

- **Client-side hooks** (your machine):
    
    - Example: `pre-commit` â†’ runs before commit is saved.
    - Block bad commits (e.g., stop commits if linting fails).
    
- **Server-side hooks** (on remote repo):
    
    - Example: `pre-receive` â†’ blocks incoming pushes if they fail validation.

### **Let's look at pre-commit hooks & example tools:**
#### Pre-commit Hooks

- Purpose: Catch issues **before** code is committed to Git.
- For example, we can create a `.git/hooks/pre-commit` script that:
  1. Blocks commits if staged changes contain `TODO`.
  2. Runs `black` and `isort` to auto-format code.
  3. Runs `flake8` for linting.

#### **Example tools we can use in pre-commit hooks:**

##### **Formatters**

- **Black**:
	- An **uncompromising Python code formatter**. Its job is to take your messy, inconsistently spaced code and reformat it to a single, beautiful standard. The key thing about Black is that it's **opinionated**. That means there are almost no configuration options. You don't argue with Black; you just let it do its thing. 
	- Its goal is to eliminate debates about code style entirely. By running Black, you get a clean, consistent format across your entire project, no matter who wrote the code.
	- Usage:
	    ```bash
	    # run on all python files in the current directory resursively.
		black .  
		# same as above but silent execution (no output).
		# note: good for use in pre-commit hook.
		black . --quiet  
		# checks only. no auto formatting like above two.
		# note: good for use in CI workflow.
		black --check  
	    ```

- **isort**:
	- isort is a tool that **sorts your imports**. It automatically organizes all your import statements at the top of your Python files.
	- Usage:
	    ```bash
	    # run on all python files in the current directory resursively.
	    # note: good for use in pre-commit hook.
	    isort . 
	    # be compatiable with Black's formatting.
	    # note: good for use in CI workflow.
	    isort . --profile black 
	    ```

##### **Linting**

- **flake8**:
	- Checks Python code for PEP8 compliance and common issues.
	- Run after formatters to catch logic/style issues that formatters donâ€™t fix.
	- Usage:
		```bash
		flake8 .  # run on all python files in the current directory resursively.
		```

##### **Coverage**

- **Coverage** measures how much of your code is executed by tests.
- Command:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=term-missing
  ```
- Fail pipeline if coverage < threshold:
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=apps --cov-fail-under=80
  ```

## **4. GitHub Actions (Cloud CI/CD)**

GitHub Actions lets you create `.yml` workflows that run **in GitHubâ€™s cloud** whenever events happen in your repo.

**Example Workflow:** Runs tests every time you push to `main`.

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** You store this file in `.github/workflows/` directory.

---
## **5. Workflow in Real Life**

1. You **commit & push** â†’ Pre-commit hook checks your code.
2. Push passes â†’ GitHub Actions runs tests.
3. If tests pass â†’ PR can be merged.
4. Merge to main â†’ Deploy pipeline triggers (optional).

---

## **6. Why This Matters**

- Stops bugs **before** they hit production.
- Automates boring tasks (tests, builds, deploys).
- Builds trust in the `main` branch â€” always stable, always deployable.
