# 📚 Git Learning & Reference Guide

Hi All - I am Vipin Garg, author of this repo which is intended for learning Git.

This repository serves as a comprehensive, self-authored learning resource for Git, created to build a strong foundation and a troubleshooting mindset.

It is part of my personal portfolio on IaC skillsets - showcasing my commitment to learn new things (I was a classic Network Engineer who didn't have any IaC/Automation/Programming skills), ability to organize & create detailed in-depth documentation.

## 📖 What's Inside

This guide is structured to facilitate learning from foundational concepts to advanced topics. The content is divided into three main sections:

### **Lessons**

High-level overview notes covering key Git concepts. These are designed to be quick reads that introduce a topic and link to deeper resources.

- **L001 - Git Foundation**: Core concepts like what Git is, the working directory, and the command flow.
    
- **L002 - Branching & Conflict Resolution**: The fundamentals of working with branches and resolving merge conflicts.
    
- **L003 - Stashing, Pushing, Cherry-picking, Tagging**: Intermediate topics for managing your workflow.
    
- **L004 - Interactive Rebasing & Squashing**: Advanced techniques for cleaning up commit history.

### **Knowledge Base (KBs)**

Detailed articles that explain the "why" behind each Git command and concept. These are meant for in-depth understanding and serve as a robust reference when you need to recall how something works.

### **Exercises**

Hands-on exercises designed to challenge your understanding and build practical skills. Each exercise walks you through real-world scenarios, complete with example commands and expected output.

## 💻 Command References

For quick lookups, this repository also includes a dedicated section with concise reference guides for essential Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git rebase`, and more.
