#### **What it is:**

A Git conflict is a situation that arises when two different branches have made changes to the same lines in the same file. Git cannot automatically decide which change to keep, so it stops the merge (or rebase, or cherry-pick) and asks you to manually resolve the disagreement.

#### **Purpose:**

Conflicts are not an error; they are a necessary part of collaborative development. Their purpose is to prevent Git from making a potentially destructive or incorrect assumption about how to combine divergent changes. By stopping and requiring a manual resolution, Git ensures that the final code is a deliberate and correct combination of both branches' changes.

#### **Real world application**

In a team environment, multiple developers are often working on the same files. A conflict can occur when two developers make different changes to the same lines of code. For example, two developers might work on a user login file. One developer changes the email validation, while another changes the password validation on the same lines. Git will flag this as a conflict, forcing the developers to manually review the changes and decide how the final code should be written.
#### **Example Commands:**

- **Trigger a conflict (in a merge):**
 
    ```bash
    # Make a change and commit on main
    git checkout main
    echo "new line on main" >> file.txt
    git commit -am "main: added new line"
    
    # Make a different change on the same line on a feature branch
    git checkout feature/conflict
    echo "new line on feature" >> file.txt
    git commit -am "feature: added conflicting line"
    
    # Try to merge, which triggers a conflict
    git checkout main
    git merge feature/conflict
    # CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.txt
    ```

- **Resolve a conflict:**

    ```bash
    # Open the conflicted file and see the markers
    # <<<<<<< HEAD
    # new line on main
    # =======
    # new line on feature
    # >>>>>>> feature/conflict
    
    # Edit the file to the final, correct version
    # (e.g., delete the markers and combine the lines)
    # new line on main
    # new line on feature
    
    # Stage the resolved file
    git add file.txt
    
    # Commit the merge
    git commit -m "Merged feature/conflict and resolved the conflict"
    ```

- **Abort an in-progress merge with conflicts:**
 
    ```bash
    git merge --abort
    ```
