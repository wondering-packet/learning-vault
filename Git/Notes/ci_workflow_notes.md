Gotcha big dawg üêæ ‚Äî we‚Äôll build **Lesson 7** from scratch for someone who‚Äôs a Git master-in-training but **fresh** to CI/CD.

## **Lesson 7 ‚Äî CI/CD Git Integration Basics**

### **1. What the heck is CI/CD?**

- **CI** = **Continuous Integration**
    
    - Automatically test & validate your code every time you push changes.
        
    - Goal: Catch bugs early & keep `main` branch stable.
        
- **CD** = **Continuous Delivery** / **Continuous Deployment**
    
    - Automatically deploy tested code to production or staging after it passes CI checks.
        
    - **Delivery** ‚Üí Requires a human to approve deploy.
        
    - **Deployment** ‚Üí Fully automated deploy.
        

**üí° Analogy:**  
Think of CI/CD like having a robotic pit crew. Every time you bring your car (code) into the pit (push), they **check it**, **fix issues**, and **send it out** without you lifting a wrench.

---

### **2. Where Git Fits into CI/CD**

Git acts as the **trigger** for automation.

- Push code ‚Üí Automation pipeline runs.
    
- Merge PR ‚Üí Tests run automatically.
    
- Tag release ‚Üí Deployment job runs.
    

---

### **3. Git Hooks**

Git itself has a built-in **hooks** system:

- **Client-side hooks** (your machine):
    
    - Example: `pre-commit` ‚Üí runs before commit is saved.
        
    - Block bad commits (e.g., stop commits if linting fails).
        
- **Server-side hooks** (on remote repo):
    
    - Example: `pre-receive` ‚Üí blocks incoming pushes if they fail validation.
        

---

### **4. GitHub Actions (Cloud CI/CD)**

GitHub Actions lets you create `.yml` workflows that run **in GitHub‚Äôs cloud** whenever events happen in your repo.

**Example Workflow:** Runs tests every time you push to `main`.

```yaml
name: Run Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest
```

üí° **Note:** You store this file in `.github/workflows/` directory.

---

### **5. Pre-commit Hook Example**

Local hook to block commits if there are lint errors:

```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running linter..."
flake8 .
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Lint failed, commit aborted."
  exit 1
fi
```

To enable:

```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

### **6. Workflow in Real Life**

1. You **commit & push** ‚Üí Pre-commit hook checks your code.
    
2. Push passes ‚Üí GitHub Actions runs tests.
    
3. If tests pass ‚Üí PR can be merged.
    
4. Merge to main ‚Üí Deploy pipeline triggers (optional).
    

---

### **7. Why This Matters**

- Stops bugs **before** they hit production.
    
- Automates boring tasks (tests, builds, deploys).
    
- Builds trust in the `main` branch ‚Äî always stable, always deployable.

‚úÖ **Next Step:**  
We‚Äôll do a **hands-on exercise**:

1. Create a repo.
    
2. Add a pre-commit hook that blocks commits with `TODO` in code.
    
3. Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs a Python linter (`flake8`) on push.

Do you want me to **jump into the exercise setup right now**, or should I **also give you a mini visual diagram** of how Git + CI/CD flows?
