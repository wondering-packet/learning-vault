## 📚 Git Learning & Reference Guide

Hi there — I’m **Vipin Garg**, the author of this Git learning repository.

This repo is a comprehensive, structured learning resource I’ve built to develop a strong foundation in Git, troubleshoot effectively, and improve my version control workflows.

It’s also part of my personal **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** learning portfolio — reflecting my journey as a traditional **Network Engineer** transitioning into the world of **Automation, Git, and DevOps tooling**.

## 📖 What’s Inside

This guide is designed to help you learn Git progressively — from first principles to advanced topics — through structured lessons, hands-on exercises, and reference notes.

The repo is divided into four sections:

### 🧪 **Lessons**

These are high-level topic summaries meant to introduce core concepts and link to deeper resources. 

- **L001 - Git Foundation**: What Git is, how it works, the basic command flow.
- **L002 - Branching & Conflict Resolution**: Core branching operations and merge conflict handling.
- **L003 - Stashing, Pushing, Cherry-picking, Tagging**: Intermediate topics for improving workflow.
- **L004 - Interactive Rebasing & Squashing**: Advanced history-cleanup techniques.

> **AI Note**: These lessons were written and formatted with the help of ChatGPT, but I’ve personally tested and validated each concept in my lab environment.

### 📘 **Knowledge Base (KBs)**

These articles explain the *why* behind Git commands and behaviors. Think of this as your Git "second brain" — built for reference and deeper understanding.

> **AI Note**: AI assisted me in structuring and editing some KBs, but every topic has been lab-tested and fact-checked by me.

### 🧠 **Exercises**

Practical, real-world Git scenarios to sharpen your skills. These are 100% written and executed by me — no AI assistance. Each one is built to reinforce concepts in an applied context.

> **Personal Note**: All exercises were crafted and performed by me in a lab enviro— they reflect my learning style and debugging habits. No AI.

### 💻 **Command References**

Quick reference notes for essential Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, `git rebase`, `git switch`, and more.

> **AI Note**: These were formatted with some help from ChatGPT, but verified entirely through hands-on testing.
