### What Git Is
1. Git is a **distributed version control system** — every developer has the full history locally.
2. Tracks changes to files over time.
3. Allows collaboration and rollback.

### Local vs Remote
- **Local repo** → your machine
- **Remote repo** → hosted service like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

### Core States in Git
1. **Working Directory** – where you edit files.
2. **Staging Area** – prepared changes ready to commit.
3. **Repository** – committed history stored locally.

### Command Flow
1. Edit files → Working Directory  
2. `git add` → Staging Area  
3. `git commit` → Local Repository  
4. `git push` → Remote Repository
