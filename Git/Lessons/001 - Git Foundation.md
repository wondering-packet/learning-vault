### What Git Is
- Git is a **distributed version control system** — every developer has the full history locally.
- Tracks changes to files over time.
- Allows collaboration and rollback.

### Local vs Remote
- **Local repo** → your machine
- **Remote repo** → hosted service like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

### Core States in Git
- **Working Directory** – where you edit files.
- **Staging Area** – prepared changes ready to commit.
- **Repository** – committed history stored locally.

### Command Flow
- Edit files → Working Directory  
- `git add` → Staging Area  
- `git commit` → Local Repository  
- `git push` → Remote Repository
